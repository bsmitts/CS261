Run your program with each of the five example graph and compute the reachability between each pair of
nodes using both BFS and DFS on each. Then answer the following questions:

1. How is the graph stored in the provided code -- adjacency matrix or edge list?

Edge list

2. Which of the graphs are connected? How can you tell?

We are given the number of vertices and edges in the graph.  

3. Imagine that we ran each search in the other direction (from destination to source, instead of source to
destination) -- would the output change at all? What if the graphs were directed graphs?

4. What are a few pros and cons of DFS vs. BFS?

5. What's the Big O execution time to determine if a node is reachable from another node?
